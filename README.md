Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction (Logistic Regression model)

# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Kaggle)

A beginner-friendly machine learning project using the Titanic dataset.

## 🎯 Objective
Predict passenger survival using logistic regression and feature engineering.

## 📊 Key Features
- Feature engineering with `Title`, `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`, `Fare_per_person`
- Missing value imputation by Title
- Model tuning via `GridSearchCV`
- Final ROC AUC: **0.869**, Submission Score: **0.76794**

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Gained understanding of end-to-end ML workflow
- Improved feature engineering intuition
- Experienced hyperparameter tuning
